according to all known laws of aviation
a blessing in disguise
a bunch
a dime a dozen
beat around the bush
better late than never
bite the bullet
break a leg
call it a day
cut somebody some slack
cutting corners
dead tired
easy does it
excuse me
get it out of my system
get it out of your system
get out of hand
get something out of my system
get something out of your system
get your act together
give someone the benefit of the doubt
go back to the drawing board
good idea
hang in there
hit the nail on the head
hit the sack
how does that sound?
i don't know
i don't understand
i love you
i owe you one
i'm fine
i'm fine, thanks
i'm really sorry
i'm sorry
it cost an arm and a leg
it costs an arm and a leg
it'll cost an arm and a leg
it will cost an arm and a leg
it's not rocket science
i've never given it much thought
kill two birds with one stone
killing two birds with one stone
let you off the hook
let me off the hook
look, it's
make a long story short
miss the boat
never gonna give you up
no pain, no gain
on the ball
once upon a time
pull your leg
pulling your leg
pull yourself together
proof of concept
so far so good
so much
speak of the devil
thanks so much
thank you so much
that's the last straw
the best of both worlds
this is a test
time flies when you're having fun
to be honest
to get bent out of shape
to kill a mockingbird
to make matters worse
under the weather
watch out
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it
whatever floats your boat
whatever you say
wrap your head around something
you can say that again
your guess is as good as mine
there's no such thing as a free lunch
throw caution to the wind
you can't have your cake and eat it too
have your cake and eat it too
judge a book by its cover
book by its cover
last straw
shut up
be quiet
how are you?
never gonna give you up
water under the bridge
let you down
birds and the bees
pair of trainers
i'd really like
i wouldn't mind
i could do with
